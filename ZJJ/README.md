ABOUT WORK 3

With MQTT, we can control the player in Minecraft by shaking our heads!

When we shake our heads, MQTT can detect the changes of our head and then go forward/back/left/right.

ABOUT WORK 4

We can control the player in Minecraft to move freely with the package 'Mediapipe'.

The actions of our fingers will be catched and read by the program, and then send to Minecraft.
